# Installation

To install the differentiable random partition module and run experiments from the paper *Differentiable Random Partition Models*, make sure to add the path to the repository for the MVHG distribution to line 4 in `setup.py`.
After that, you can install the drpm using 
```
pip install .[pt]
```
In order to run the multi-task experiment or the clustering experiment, please consult the `README.md` files in their respective experiment folder under `experiments/`.
